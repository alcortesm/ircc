*** - 2008-06-19  Rotating server certificates
*** - ----------------------------------------
*** - We are slowly rotating our servers' SSL certificates.  The new
*** - certs are signed, indirectly, by SPI's certification authority
*** - and no longer by cacert's.
*** - 
*** - If you use SSL to connect to our network (ports 6697 and 9999)
*** - and you verify the certs you need to get SPI's root cert from
*** - <URL:http://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/spi-cacert.crt/view>.
*** - 
*** - 
*** - 2007-11-23  Enabling ssl client certificates
*** - --------------------------------------------
*** - NickServ now supports auto-identification using SSL connections
*** - and client certificates.
*** - 
*** - Please see http://www.oftc.net/oftc/NickServ/CertFP for
*** - more information.
