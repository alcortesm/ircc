Notes:

>From RFC 1123:

2.1 Host Names and Numbers

The syntax of a legal Internet host name was specified in RFC-952
[DNS:4]. One aspect of host name syntax is hereby changed: the
restriction on the first character is relaxed to allow either a
letter or a digit. Host software MUST support this more liberal
syntax.


In RFC 952 the definition of a shortname looks like this

<name> ::=3D <let>[*[<let-or-digit-or-hyphen>]<let-or-digit>]
