- Msg should have a Factory static method instead of msg_factory.cc
- Server should not have nick or channel, there should be a User class
- Msg should not need a Server or User at ctor, only Run need them
- remove com_factory clean debug message
- CommandFactory return a pointer, but I would like to return a
   reference to avoid deleting the object afterwards, let the scope
   rules do the work for me.
