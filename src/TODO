- MOTd with more than one line might not work!
- Msg should have a Factory static method instead of msg_factory.cc
- Server should not have nick or channel, there should be a User class
- CommandFactory return a pointer, but I would like to return a
   reference to avoid deleting the object afterwards, let the scope
   rules do the work for me.
