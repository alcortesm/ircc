- A ComDisconnect is needed
- A ComServer command must have ComConnect ComNick and its run must run
   its members
- The line processed by CommandFactory must be cleaned if command is not /msg
- CommandFactory return a pointer, but I would like to return a
   reference to avoid deleting the object afterwards, let the scope
   rules do the work for me.
- Modify QUIT to notify server
- Add args or command for NICK
- Add args or command for USER
- Add command for JOIN
- Add command for SEND
- Add server class to allow connection, Think this.
