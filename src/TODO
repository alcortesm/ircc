- add user message for all commands
- add debug messages to all Com... ctors
- remove /nick and make /user do all the work
- add message for numeric responses:
  *** bla has left channel #ro2 (bla)
  *** bla (~alcortes@localhost) has joined channel #ro2
  *** Topic for #ro2: RO2 Channel
  *** #ro2 -Server- 1284296339
- add /disconnect
- add /list
- The line processed by CommandFactory must be cleaned if command is not /msg
- CommandFactory return a pointer, but I would like to return a
   reference to avoid deleting the object afterwards, let the scope
   rules do the work for me.
