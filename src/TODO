- server should not create new channel if a user join a non-existing one
- Fix Server::Send debug output to avoid \r\n
- A ComDisconnect is needed
- A ComServer command must have ComConnect ComNick and its run must run
   its members
- The line processed by CommandFactory must be cleaned if command is not /msg
- CommandFactory return a pointer, but I would like to return a
   reference to avoid deleting the object afterwards, let the scope
   rules do the work for me.
- Modify QUIT to notify server
