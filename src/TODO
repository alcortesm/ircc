- there is a need for a server object where all the socket status is
  stored and is used by many commands, main should create one, and it
  should be able to delete it and create other or mutate it, don't know
  what is better
- Add commands to connect (SERVER host[:port])
- CommandFactory return a pointer, but I would like to return a
   reference to avoid deleting the object afterwards, let the scope
   rules do the work for me.
- Modify QUIT to notify server
- Add args or command for NICK
- Add args or command for USER
- Add command for JOIN
- Add command for SEND
- Add server class to allow connection, Think this.
